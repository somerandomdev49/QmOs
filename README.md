# QmOS

# TODO:
- port PortableGL here!
- filesystem
- multithreading?
- malloc
- reorganise the header files.

- driver-agnostic scrolling
  (add flag for having a getchar func)
  * requires malloc

As the filesystem im using doesnt store file/folder creation time, I estimate that the first file I created and never edited again is `linker.ld`, which was last modified 2021-08-19. Who knows, this started a lot earlier probably
